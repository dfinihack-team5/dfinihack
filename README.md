# roadmap_prediction_market

Welcome to your new roadmap_prediction_market project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with roadmap_prediction_market, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd roadmap_prediction_market/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

You can interact with it using `dfx canister call`:

```bash
# Add a profile
dfx canister call roadmap_prediction_market update '(record {name = "Luxi"; description = "mountain dog"; keywords = vec {"scars"; "toast"}})'

# Retrieve your profile
dfx canister call roadmap_prediction_market getSelf
```

This is based on the [Profile tutorial](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/rust-guide/rust-profile.html),
using `roadmap_prediction_market` as a name instead of `rust_profile` so most of the commands there
apply (with the changed canister name).

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

## Issues and workarounds

If you run into this error while running `dfx deploy`:

```
error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed
```

You need to install support for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
